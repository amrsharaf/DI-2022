- **Title:** What’s in a Chemical Entity?
- **Abstract:** Like many scientific fields, new chemistry literature has grown at a staggering pace, with tens of thousands of papers released every month. In our newly created U.S. NSF AI Institute on Molecular Synthesis, we are applying knowledge extraction techniques to automatically construct knowledge bases from scientific literature. The constructed knowledge bases include chemical entities and reactions between entities, and thus they can be used to predict chemical reactions, products, and properties, such as yield, toxicity, and water solubility, for creating new molecules and improving manufacture of target molecules.  However, existing information extraction techniques developed for news domain or even biomedical literature will not be directly effective for chemistry literature. One reason is that chemical entities are often complex formula-like names (e.g., 5,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxylic acid). Moreover, many chemicals simply have never been coined with any nomenclature in natural language. Therefore the chemical entity mentions are essentially rare terms that cannot be learned well by only language model. In pursuit of this goal, we propose a novel multimodal embedding approach for constructing a shared common semantic space among multiple data modalities: (1) 2-D images of molecules, representing the underlying molecules or reactions; (2) text-based molecule descriptors; (3) chemical graph structure; (4) natural language definition and description; and (5) structured properties in external databases. I will then present the applications of this common semantic space in building an end-to-end knowledge extraction system for chemistry literature, and using the constructed knowledge base for cross-modal chemical entity retrieval with natural language, and molecule descriptor string generation from molecular diagram images. I’ll present a new benchmark that includes 81 million molecules and 100 chemistry papers fully annotated with a new fine-grained Chemistry ontology. I’ll also talk about remaining challenges and ongoing work on representing chemical reactions.
- **Bio:** **[Heng Ji](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/hengji)** is a professor at Computer Science Department, and an affiliated faculty member at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She is an Amazon Scholar. She received her B.A. and M. A. in Computational Linguistics from Tsinghua University, and her M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from New York University. Her research interests focus on Natural Language Processing, especially on Multimedia Multilingual Information Extraction, Knowledge Base Population and Knowledge-driven Generation. She was selected as "Young Scientist" and a member of the Global Future Council on the Future of Computing by the World Economic Forum in 2016 and 2017. The awards she received include "AI's 10 to Watch" Award by IEEE Intelligent Systems in 2013, NSF CAREER award in 2009, Google Research Award in 2009 and 2014, IBM Watson Faculty Award in 2012 and 2014, Bosch Research Award in 2014-2018, and ACL2020 Best Demo Paper Award. She has served as the Program Committee Co-Chair of many conferences including NAACL-HLT2018. She is elected as the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) secretary 2020-2021.

- **Title:** Challenges in Enterprise Search and Intelligence
- **Abstract:** Building effective enterprise search and intelligence capabilities at scale presents a number of significant challenges. The goal of this talk is to highlight research-focused challenges that are often encountered when developing such systems. The challenges covered in the talk, all of which are backed by real-world use cases, include document understanding, query understanding, and question answering.
- **Bio:** **[Don Metzler](https://research.google/people/DonaldMetzler/)** is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google, where he leads a group focused on problems at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Previously, he was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California (USC) and a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo!.  He has served as the Program Chair of the ACM Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR), and the Open Research Areas in Information Retrieval (OAIR) conferences, sat on the editorial boards of the major journals in the field, published over 100 research papers, has been awarded 9 patents, and co-authored the textbook Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice.
