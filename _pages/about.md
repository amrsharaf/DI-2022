# Workshop Summary

Business documents are central to the operation of business. Such documents
include sales agreements, vendor contracts, mortgage terms, loan applications,
purchase orders, invoices, financial statements, employment agreements and a
wide many more. The information in such business documents is presented in
natural language, and can be organized in a variety of ways from straight text,
multi-column formats, and a wide variety of tables. Understanding these
documents is made challenging due to inconsistent formats, poor quality scans
and OCR, internal cross references, and complex document structure.
Furthermore, these documents often reflect complex legal agreements and
reference, explicitly or implicitly, regulations, legislation, case law and
standard business practices.

The ability to read, understand and interpret business documents, collectively
referred to as “Document Intelligence”, is a critical and challenging
application of artificial intelligence (AI) in business. While a variety of
research has advanced the fundamentals of document understanding, the majority
have focused on documents found on the web which fail to capture the complexity
of analysis and types of understanding needed across business documents.
Realizing the vision of Document Intelligence remains a research challenge that
requires a multi-disciplinary perspective spanning not only natural language
processing and understanding, but also computer vision, knowledge
representation and reasoning, information retrieval, and more -- all of which
have been profoundly impacted and advanced by neural network-based approaches
and deep learning in the last few years.  

The goal of DI 2019 Workshop is to bring together AI researchers, academics and
industry practitioners to discuss the opportunities and challenges for Document
Intelligence. The workshop will be a 1-day workshop consisting of presentations
by invited speakers on research, academic and industry challenges and recent
progress in Document Intelligence topic. The workshop will embrace open
discussions in form of breakout sessions and/or panel discussions reflecting on
the major challenges in Document Intelligence, as well as a poster session for
presenting the accepted peer-reviewed papers.
